# Plagiarism Project, Machine Learning Deployment

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification. Text files are labeled as *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that files to a provided source text.
